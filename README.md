# svd_kriging

This code uses SVD outputs as covariats into Universal Kriging which is also known as Regression Kriging. The code is produced in an RNotebook so that R and Python can run in one notebook. This code uses the 2016 Zillow data from the Zillow Kaggle Challenge which can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/zillow-prize-1/data. The two files that are used are 1) properties_2016.csv and 2) train_2016_v2.csv. These files should be downloaded to the "data" folder.
